Adds rope ladders which don't need support (except at the top!) and can be
easily wound and unwound.

Right click on a rope ladder with rope ladders in hand to extend the ladder
downwards by one. Shift-Right click on a rope ladder to wind it up by one.

Recipe:

S S
SWS
S S

Where 'S' is string  and 'W' is a stick. Yields 2.

Requires ModLoader. Uses blockID 245.

Conflicts: Anything that modifies EntityLiving (ls.class). That file requires
a small edit to allow rope ladders to behave as normal ladders.

Note: The modification for EntityLiving should work with all mods that add
ladders, provided they extended BlockLadder. If you're developing a ladder
mod, you can probably just copy this EntityLiving into your mod to ensure
compatibility!
