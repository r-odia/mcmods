Like the alpha winter mode, this mod makes it snow everywhere all the time.
Uninstalling will cause snow and ice to melt in places where it would
normally. Also allows snow to fall on top of glass blocks.

Required ModLoader.

Conflicts: Anything that modifies BiomeGenBase (kd.class)
           Anything that modifies World (fd.class)

Note: you can simply remove fd.class before installing if it would create a
conflict. The only effect this will have is that snow will not accumulate on
top of glass.
